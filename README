Itch that needs scratching: I need a way to keep track of all of the small items I need to do during the day. These items are not major projects and hence would not be added to your conventional 'task' list.
These are small tasks that you need to remmeber, but don't need to keep track of once they're completed.

Examples:
1. Make sure to checkin such such into source control
2. Respond to _____ e-mail
3. Tell ___ that 1 p.m. this weekend sounds good to hang out.
4. Fill out ____ for ____ 
etc...
